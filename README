Work Sample Assessment - Background Information
In this section, you will be presented background information on this year's Work Sample Assessment theme. This theme will help guide the specific task you are given for the role(s) that you applied for. 

Keep in mind that this scenario is hypothetical. All work completed in this assessment is for the Xtern application process.

Please read all background information before moving on to the next page to select your assessments.

Note: You MUST complete the assessments associated with roles you initially applied for.  Any submissions that do not match to an initial application will not be graded.  You may find the roles you initially applied for within your Work Sample Assessment invitation email.

You do not need to complete two Work Sample Assessments if you do not want to, you can complete only one based on which internship position you would like to continue on with in the process. For example, if you preference a Business Analyst internship and a Marketing internship when you applied to Xtern and only complete the Work Sample Assessment for Marketing you would only be moving forward through the process for the Marketing internship, not the Business Analyst internship. If you completed both Work Sample Assessments you would then move forward in the process for both positions, however, in the end you will only hold one internship position.
